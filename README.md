# GUI Automation Project
## Avery Anderson, Joshua Royal, and Olivia KaChenChai
### About
For this project we wanted to make a user-friendly interface for task automation. In administration roles, tasks like creating and disabling accounts can be simple. But when faced with disabling or enabling, for example 100 accounts, the task can become quite tedious. We have been working on creating a script to make these tasks run with a click of a button. This is an on-going project and many more tasks can be added to the script for automation depending on the administrative role the individual is in. 
#### Load the Winforms assembly
#### Create the form
#### Set the dialog title
#### Create Main Form Label 
#### Create the label control and set text, size and location
#### Create TextBox and set text, size and location

#### Set up event handler to extarct text from TextBox and display it on the Label.
#### Disable User Script
