# GUI Automation Project
## Avery Anderson, Joshua Royal, and Olivia KaChenChai
### About
For this project we wanted to make a user-friendly interface for task automation. In administration roles, tasks like creating and disabling accounts can be simple. But when faced with disabling or enabling, for example 100 accounts, the task can become quite tedious. We have been working on creating a script to make these tasks run with a click of a button. This is an on-going project and many more tasks can be added to the script for automation depending on the administrative role the individual is in.
